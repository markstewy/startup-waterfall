# MEAN-Seed Raw
This is a full-stack angular starter template without any formatting ie. bootstrap or angular material.

This template was updated to follow (in part) the angular style guide put forth by John Papa. The folder and module structure
is somewhat overkill, but the idea is to have a quick foundation for much larger applications.

Currently excludes unit testing.
